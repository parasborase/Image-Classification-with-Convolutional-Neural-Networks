# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Project Overview

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that can classify images into one of the ten classes defined by the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and deployment of the model through a web interface.

Tools and Technologies:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, PIL, NumPy, Scikit-learn
•	Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Frontend Framework: Flask (Python)

1.Dataset

Dataset Used:
CIFAR-10

Description:
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Classes:
•	Airplane
•	Automobile
•	Bird
•	Cat
•	Deer
•	Dog
•	Frog
•	Horse
•	Ship
•	Truck

Source:
The dataset is publicly available and can be loaded directly using the tensorflow.keras.datasets module.

2. Data Preprocessing

Image Resizing:
All images are resized to 32x32 pixels, which is the standard size for CIFAR-10 images.

Normalization:
Pixel values of images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255. This helps in faster convergence during training.

One-Hot Encoding:
The class labels are converted to binary class matrices using one-hot encoding, where each class label is represented as a vector with a single high bit (1) and the rest as low bits (0).

Data Augmentation:
To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and flipping are applied using the ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow.

3. Model Architecture

Model Type:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Architecture Details:
•	Input Layer: 32x32x3 (for CIFAR-10 images)
•	Conv2D Layers: Two convolutional layers with 32 and 64 filters, respectively. The ReLU activation function is used.
•	MaxPooling2D Layers: Max pooling is applied after each convolutional layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
•	Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D matrix data to a 1D vector before feeding it to the Dense layers.
•	Dense Layers: A fully connected layer with 128 neurons, followed by a Dropout layer for regularization.
•	Output Layer: 10 neurons (one for each class) with a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

Regularization Techniques:
L2 regularization is applied to reduce overfitting, and dropout is used to further improve model robustness.

Optimizer Used:
Adam optimizer, known for its adaptive learning rate, is used for model training.

Loss Function:
Categorical Crossentropy is used, which is standard for multi-class classification problems.

Learning Rate Scheduling:
A learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau) is used to reduce the learning rate when the validation loss plateaus, helping in finer training adjustments.

4. Training Process

Training-Testing Split:
The CIFAR-10 dataset comes pre-split, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

Epochs:
The model is trained for 10 epochs.

Batch Size:
64
Training Logs:
Accuracy and loss are monitored over the epochs, with the model’s performance visualized through the history object.

Augmented Training:
The model is trained using the augmented data generated by ImageDataGenerator.

5. Evaluation Results

Accuracy:
The final accuracy of the model on the test data is evaluated, showing promising results.

Classification Report:
A classification report generated using Scikit-learn’s classification_report function provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Confusion Matrix:
While not shown in the provided code, a confusion matrix could be generated to visualize misclassifications across classes.

6. Deployment

Framework:
Flask

Endpoints:
•	/: The home page for image uploads.
•	/predict: Endpoint that handles image classification and returns the predicted class.

Frontend:
The web interface includes an HTML form for uploading images, with a preview of the uploaded image displayed before submission. After submitting the image, the prediction is displayed on a new page.

Backend:
The backend logic involves loading the trained CNN model (cnn_cifar10_model.keras), preprocessing the uploaded image to match the input requirements of the model, and making a prediction using the model.
